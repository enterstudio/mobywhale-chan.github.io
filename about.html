<section>
  <p>Hello! I'm Fiona - a fun-size, food-loving front-end developer based in Sydney, Australia.</p>

  <p>My first job was a junior graphic designer at a print company. But I got bored of it very quickly. I decided I needed to be in an industry that is always changing and moving forward, and what better industry to be in than the web!</p>

  <p>I love CSS, I love talking to people about front-end and I love learning any new things in this ever-changing web world. I'm also passionate about usability and accessibility. We need to think about our users y'all!</p>

  <p>I have a lot of experience in architecting large scale front-end, creating modular CSS and setting front-end standards. Currently I'm enjoying life as a contractor, so if you have any interesting opportunities that you think I'd be a good fit for, shoot me an <a href="mailto:fiona@fionachan.net">email</a>!</p>

  <p>Outside of web, you can find me planning what to eat for my next meal and daydreaming about the <a href="http://instagram.com/p/U-BPs0C2n4/">street food</a> in Vietnam.</p>
