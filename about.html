<section>
  <p>Hello! I'm Fiona - a fun-size, food-loving technical recruiter at <a href="http://lookahead.com.au">Lookahead Search</a> based in Sydney, Australia. I was a front-end developer for a long time, but decided to try something new while still remain in the tech industry.</p>

  <p>I love CSS, I love talking to people about front-end and I love learning any new things in this ever-changing web world. I'm also passionate about usability and accessibility. We need to think about our users y'all!</p>

  <p>As a front-end developer, I have a lot of experience in architecting large scale front-end, creating modular CSS and setting front-end standards.</p>
  
  <p>As a technical recruiter now, I want to connect great people with great companies. Hopefully help people find their dream jobs!</p>
  
  <p>I'm also one of the organisers for <a href="http://sydcss.com">SydCSS</a> and <a href="http://2014.cssconf.com.au/">CSSConf 2014</a>. I really love being involved in the community!</p>
  
  <p>Outside of web, you can find me planning what to eat for my next meal and daydreaming about the <a href="http://instagram.com/p/U-BPs0C2n4/">street food</a> in Vietnam.</p>
