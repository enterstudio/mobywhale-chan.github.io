## Lessons Learnt From Running a Meetup

It's been a bit more than 1 year since [David](http://twitter.com/dp_lewis) and I started [SydCSS](http://sydcss.com) and what a fun year it's been! We started with not really knowing what we were doing, but after a bit of trial and error, I think we now have a pretty good idea of what works well and what doesn't. Every meetup is different, but these are the things that have worked out well for us:

### Organise it with someone
Organising things take a lot of time. It's particularly harder when you can only do it after work or on the weekend. It's also a lot less fun doing it on your own. Working with David has been awesome. We are lucky that we work very well together. We split the worklaod, bounce ideas off each other, MC together... I certainly had a lot of fun and know that SydCSS wouldn't be where it is without his help and some of his (at times crazy) ideas ;) I honestly cannot ask for a better co-organiser.

### Providing fingerfood
Right from the beginning, we didn't like the idea of providing pizza at the meetup. Most meetups have pizzas and personally, I get quite tired of them. I understand why people serve them. They are cheap and can fill a hungry stomach very easily. To provide anything that's not pizza but also filling is costly. As an alternative, we thought maybe we could serve snacks and fingerfood. It started with [homemade popcorn](http://fionachan.net/2013/10/first-sydcss.html) and every meetup we provide different snacks. Other than gingerbread men for the two December meetups, we haven't repeated the same food idea yet! We were worried at the start that people will complain about not having food that's filling. But we let people know well in advance that there'll only be fingerfood so they should grab a bite before they come to the meetup. So far this plan is going well. By the way, if you're looking for economical catering option, you should totally get in touch with [Made By Mith](https://www.facebook.com/madebymith). They've been making all the very yummy fingerfood for SydCSS and also for RailsGirls recently.

### Keep the night short and sweet
We start the night at about
