A coupe of weeks ago, I attended the first [a11y Camp](http://a11ybytes.org/a11y-camp/) in Sydney - a full day of talks about all things accessibility. Accessibility is a subject that doesnâ€™t get talked about enough so it was great that there was a whole day dedicated to it. The day was filled with LOTS of great information about how to create an accessible website, but for me the biggest takeaway was how the speakers presented. I noticed how they would describe verbally the images they had on their slides, or deliberately read out all the text that's on their slides. That was really important to the visually impaired attendees on the day. It really struck me that I never considered this when I did my presentations. I'll have to remember this next time I present somewhere and be more aware of the fact that there might be attendees who are different to me in the crowd.
