title: CSS is easy...?

Ok, let me just start by saying I don't think CSS is easy. But I feel like that's how a lot of people feel about it still. It's not hard to get styling to work. If some styling isn't applying, you can try adding !important to your rule, or increase the specificity by specifying more selectors. If all things fail, you can try all the CSS property and value pair, and one of them will probably make something work.

But knowing the quirks behind the CSS properties, what flow-on effects they can have, how to write it in a maintainable way... these are all things that make it not as easy as you think. &lt;/rant&gt;
