2 hours until the end of 2016. While others might be out celebrating, I've been spending the day at home which started with a picnic on the balcony with Binh. We pretty much snacked and chilled out the whole afternoon and it was perfect! Now I'm happily sitting on my couch, reflecting on the year and writing my end of year blog post.

2016 was a massive year of learning, adjustment and achievement on the work side of things. I'm looking forward to doing more on the personal side in 2017.
