Finally I have time to look back on 2014 and it’s been a pretty busy year!

   * Had my [Vietnamese wedding](http://instagram.com/p/ixeOS2i2jl/?modal=true) in Hanoi and travelled around Vietnam with family and friends afterwards
   * Started to settle into my new home
   * Started working at [Learnosity](http://learnosity.com)
   * Launched the first [CSSConf AU](http://2014.cssconf.com.au/) with a few others in Melbourne
   * Spoke at [Web Directions Code](http://www.webdirections.org/code14/) in Melbourne
   * Wrote for .Net Magazine
   * Challenged myself and spoke at [IgniteSydney [Digital]](http://fionachan.net/2014/10/ignite-sydney-digital.html)
   * Continued to [grow SydCSS](http://fionachan.net/2014/12/one-year-reflection.html) and held our birthday bash at Sydney Uni
   * Went on belated [honeymoon to Bali](http://instagram.com/p/vCwBUfi2iA/?modal=true) and drank the best watermelon juice for every single meal

So what’s the plan for 2015?


   * Pick up my Vietnamese again
   * Continue to improve and grow SydCSS
   * Learn to sew
   * Grow my little balcony garden
   * Holiday in Hong Kong and China at the end of the year

That’s probably it for now but I’m sure there’ll be more things popping up throughout the year :)
