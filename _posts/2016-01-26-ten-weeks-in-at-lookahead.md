10 weeks in at Lookahead and I've made my first placement! Super happy about it. I was kind of lucky that the timing worked perfectly: the right job came up for the right candidate. But that's not to say I didn't work hard in getting the candidate the offer.

If anyone says to me being a recruiter is easy, I may have to punch them. It's a challenging job because people are hard. I'm really enjoying it though because I am learning SO much, like how to write good emails, how to ask the right questions, how to understand people, how to deal with difficult situations, how to multi-task etc. I find these are good life skills that I can use on a day to day basis. Even if one day I decide I want to do something else (not anytime soon!), I can still see myself using these skills in any jobs I take. 

Although I'm not coding on a daily basis, I've really enjoyed meeting developers and chatting with them. Having that technical background definitely helps me in being able to understand what developers and companies are after. I've also spent a lot of time in giving people general advice on job search and resume writing. Some of them were really appreciative of that.

I'm slowly learning that a lot of things can go wrong in this job even if I put in 110%, because people are unpredictable. But when things do work out, it really is quite satisfying :) I'm happy that I can do what I've wanted to when I joined Lookahead: helping others without compromising my beliefs and integrity.
