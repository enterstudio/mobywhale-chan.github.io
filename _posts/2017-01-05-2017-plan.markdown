The arrival of a new year is usually a time to think about goals. David and I caught up during the week to talk about our plan for SydCSS this year. We made some vague plans on people we want to ask to come speak at our events and talked briefly about doing another workshop of some kind. But what else do we want to do? What big plans do we want to make? Where do we want to take it? 

In the end, we didn't really make any grand plans. Though what we do plan on doing is continue to make SydCSS a friendly and inclusive event. Meetups can be a little intimidating especially if you don't know anyone at the event, so we want to make sure everyone feels welcomed and comfortable.

A bit of a personal goal of mine is to continue to encourage more people get into public speaking. [Simon](http://twitter.com/simonswiss) wrote a really lovely blog post about how he got into it and I was very happy to know that I played a small part in making that happen. Public speaking has done wonders for me and I've seen how it's changed others around me. They become more confident, helps grow their career
