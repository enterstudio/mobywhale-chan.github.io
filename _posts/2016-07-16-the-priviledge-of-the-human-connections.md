I've been at Lookahead for almost 9 months now, and have spoken with over a hundred people. I've never been in a job that allows me to connect with so many different people. They tell me about their work, their life, what they love doing, what they want to do in the future. They ask me for advice about their resume, career path, hiring process, company culture and many more. Sometimes they even share with me the ups and downs in their personal lives.

Through every conversation, I get to know them a little better. I feel very privileged that I get to do that and share some of their experiences: I feel their joy when they find their dream job, able to hire someone they really want on their team or finally have their permanent residency. And I feel their disappointment and sadness when they don't get that job they want, someone turn down their offer, or something sad happens in their personal lives.

I'm humbled that so many of them trust me enough to have me as their sounding board and someone they'd come to when they need advice. Some of them even became my friends. Thank you to all the people who've trusted me.
