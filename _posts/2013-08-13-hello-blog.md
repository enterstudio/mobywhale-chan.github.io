Finally, I have my own blog setup. I've always been a bit terrified about sharing my thoughts with the world. But after doing a couple of [short](http://www.stubbornella.org/content/2013/07/01/easy-peasy-rem-conversion-with-sass/) [blogposts](http://www.stubbornella.org/content/2013/07/31/re-visiting-the-secret-power-of-block-fomatting-context/) and [talks](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YtQwv1cUVs), I feel a bit more comfortable about the idea now.

This blog is still very much a work in progress, so bear with me.

Some facts about this blog:

* It's powered by Jekyll, Sass and Compass
* I was going to call it "Sprinkles" because I liked the word. But then decided against it because I know my ever-changing mind will dislike it after a while
* Time taken to choose the colour theme: 1 hour
* Time taken to choose the fonts: 4 hours
