As I'm writing this, I'm on my way home after a very long day. It started at about 11am when I got a call from my SydCSS co-organiser David to say that something came up and we had to change venue for our event. And that was happening in about 7 hours!

I probably let out the loudest F bombs anyone has ever heard me yell. So much so that our friends next door asked me later, "Was that you swearing before, Fiona?" 

So we needed a plan B. David and I started figuring out who we could call for a last minute venue. We rang people we knew from the community, emailed people, I started asking if work would let us crash the office. No one hesitated to help us. While I was panicking, everyone was reassuring me that things would be ok. We finally decided we'd use Lookahead's office and we started setting things up at around 2pm. Our neighbour whom we share the office with were lending us their office equipment. David's team from Finder carried these metal chairs from their office (5 blocks down the road) so we could have more seats. My colleagues helped move all the furniture away and got the popcorn machine going. Friends came to help us get the place ready... I can go on and on.

The night was a success. We had about 75 people turned up and I think everyone had a pretty good time! Throughout the night I was thinking, "Wow! What an amazing community I am in". Everyone has been so supportive of us. Even before today, John Allsopp was connecting us with CSSWG speakers, and they offered to give a talk on the night. Support was coming in from all directions. We really couldn't have pulled it off without everyone's help. 

I feel so lucky that I chose a career which let me be a part of such a caring and sharing community. I don't know what other industries/communities are like, but this web one is pretty f*cking amazing.

Thank you everyone.
